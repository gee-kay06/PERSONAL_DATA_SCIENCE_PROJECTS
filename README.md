# PRODIGY_INFOTECH_DATA_SCIENCE_INTERNSHIP
## This is a repository of projects I worked on during my Data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech
### Task 1: Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
#### Details
Cleaned and performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset that has been split, then built machine learning models to predict the likelihood of survival of a passenger.
#### Variable Definitions
1- age=Age in years  
2- PassengerId  
3- survival=Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes  (OUTPUT VARIABLE)  
4- pclass= Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd  
 1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower  
5- sibsp= Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic  
6- parch= Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic(Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.)  
7- ticket=Ticket number  
8- fare=Passenger fare  
9- cabin=Cabin number  
10- embarked=Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
### Task 2: Analysis and visualization of sentimental patterns in social media data
### Task 3: Prediction of a customer's likelihood to subscribe a term deposit
#### Details
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a Term deposit based on their demographic and behavioural data. 
#### The dataset can be found in the folder
It is a bank marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is related to a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns(phone calls). Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, to access if the product(Bank Term Deposit) would be yes or no
#### Variable Definitions
1 - age (numeric)  
2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","unknown","unemployed","management","housemaid","entrepreneur","student",
                                       "blue-collar","self-employed","retired","technician","services")  
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)  
4 - education (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")  
5 - default: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")  
6 - balance: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric)  
7 - housing: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")  
8 - loan: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")  
9 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular")  
10 - day: last contact day of the month (numeric)  
11 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")  
12 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)  
13 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)  
14 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)  
15 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)  
16 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")  
#### Output variable (desired target):
17 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")
